## Usefull tips.

### Working with Docker.

#### Docker Contexts.

Should create a Nix `derivation` to hold all the files for the Docker context to hold the files that the local `COPY` command in the `Dockerfile` would reference.

Note:
- Nix `pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation` automatically changes `shebang` lines for scripts to refer to paths in the Nix `store` which wouldn't work inside the docker container, so need to add `dontPatchShebangs = true;` as an attribute to the `pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation` function call.
  - Note:
    - This applies to executables.
      - Ex: The outputs of `pkgs.writeScript`, but not the outputs of `pkgs.writeText`.
  - For example by default `pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation` rewrites `#!/bin.sh` to `#!/nix/store/<hash>-some-bash/bin/sh`.
  - Reference: [NixOS - What is the `patchShebangs` command in Nix build expressions?](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/what-is-the-patchshebangs-command-in-nix-build-expressions/12656)
